C Program to Implement Booth’s Multiplication Algorithm for Multiplication of 2 signed Numbers

This is a C Program to multiply two signed numbers using booth’s algorithm. Booth’s multiplication algorithm is a multiplication algorithm that multiplies two signed binary numbers in two’s complement notation. Booth used desk calculators that were faster at shifting than adding and created the algorithm to increase their speed. Booth’s algorithm is of interest in the study of computer architecture.

The C program is successfully compiled and run on a Linux system.
